## Background

Many countries lack legal frameworks for whistleblowing, and most of those that do do not comply with the frameworks and policies to the ideal level. This makes it challenging for those willing, to come forward with useful information on: corrupt individuals, and the on-going or planned illegal/illegitimate practices.
This is so because of fear of retaliation and a lack of trust and confidence in the underlying systems (analogue/digital) to:
1. Preserve the anonymity of the whistleblower,
2. Protect the whistleblower from threatening outcomes on their lives, family, jobs, businesses and general welfare,
3. Accessibility to a fair and non-biased system,
4. Time lag associated with the submission and investigation processes

## Proposed Solution

The main goal of the project titled, "WHISTLEBLOWER: Watch-Guard" is to offer a platform that citizens can use to hold government agencies, organizations and institutions accountable in terms of service and therefore stand as a preventative measure to the act and implication of corruption.
This project aims to build a safe, secure, trustworthy, responsive and reliable product called "Watch-Guard", with blockchain as the underlying framework.
The following properties offered by a blockchain will address the main concerns of a potential whistleblower:
1. Anonymity - protection of the identity of a whistleblower.
2. Distributed - fair and non-biased acceptance of reported cases.
3. Permissionless - access to the whistleblowing service.

This solution fits well amongst those that not only enforce transparency, but also act as a preventative measure against the corruption.
A whistleblower system built on blockchain opens the door for many people to participate in the campaign against corruption, without worrying about retaliation.

## How will we measure success?

The success of this project will be measured against the following metrics:
1. Availability and ease of access to any individual with a sound understanding.
2. Protection of identity of users across the network.
3. Fair voting on validity of a case.
4. Usability and simplicity.

## Address of Sustainability Development Goals

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">![SDG 16](assets\sdg16.png)</span>

The project speaks into [SGD 16](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/) which fully states "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels" and in particular, Target 16.5: Substantially reduce corruption and bribery.

## Future Considerations

1. Incorporation of a rewarding system into the network - using cryptocurrencies without the need for a whistleblower to physically present themselves or any more information about themselves to those who need to issue a reward upon a successful investigation.
2. Capability of using the [structured] information collected over a period of time to perform valuable analytics.
3. Integration with other government systems to allow for the possibility of analysis of data flowing through these systems. The results of this analysis could give insight into multiple groups of information and perform a certain set of actions, and when the system becomes smart enough, flag inconsistencies and alert those in charge.
4. Addition of a chatbot to support users of the system.
5. Multilanguage support
6. Secure mailing system to notify the user of activity, inplace of having to check every 1/2 days.
7. Creation of randomly generated numbers (using [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf-api-reference)) that will be used by whistleblowers to track their lodged cases.
